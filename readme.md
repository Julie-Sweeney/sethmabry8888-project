# Hello World in JS

`npm run build` builds the application to `public/bundle.js`, along with a sourcemap for debugging.

`npm start` launches a server, using serve. Navigate to localhost:3000.

`npm run watch` will continually rebuild the application as your source files change.

`npm run dev` will run `npm start` and `npm run watch` in parallel.
